The readme generated by AI was really bad, i had to adjust the trade-off and â€œIf I had more time, I would" section and adjust the usage commands (readme.md)

The first file generated by the AI, had syntax errors, so I deleted it and tried again. (index.ts)

Data parsing from the CSV was bad. Because I use a Spanish windows Machine, the separator is ";" and not "," also had to include the BOM parameter (index.ts:readAndProcessPlayerData())

I corrected the debug section of main() function to show more detailed data to check effectiveness (index.ts:main())
